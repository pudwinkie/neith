This folder should also consist of:
-DekiExt.php
-DekiExtSample.php


What you need:
IXR_Library.inc.php (located at http://scripts.incutio.com/xmlrpc/ under IXR_Library.inc.php.txt, just save it as
a .php when you download it)

====================================================================================================
DekiExt.php
====================================================================================================

The DekiExt.php file contains a class called DekiExt that will handle a GET or a POST call
to a newly instantiated object of DekiExt. In order for DekiExt to work, you need to go
to http://scripts.incutio.com/xmlrpc/ and download their IXR_Library.inc.php file. This will convert the 
responses from php into XML-RPC and read XML-RPC code going to your php server.

The DekiExt handles a .php calling it (e.g. like the one in Sample.php) with a defined set of
parameters for its constructor. The parameters DekiExt takes is a title string, a array with 
pre-defined keys, and an array with keys that have parameter names/types and return types that will 
map to a function you defined in the php file. 

(e.g. new DekiExt([your xml extension title],

							array("description" => "[description of my extension]",
								  "copyright"   => "[my copyright]", 
								  "uri.help"    => "http://myServer/myHelpPage",
								  "namespace"   => "[my namespace]"),
								  
		array("FunctionOne(param1:type, param2:type):return_type" => "MyFunctionOne",
			  									  "FunctionTwo()" => "MyFunctionTwo",
			  					  "MyFunctionThree():return_type" => "MyFunctionThree")	);
)

The dekiwiki types that are allowed
for the parameters and return are:
	- any
	- nil
	- bool
	- num
	- str
	- map
	- list
	
Important NOTE: the IXR_library only interprets parameters as 1 array so you can either
remap it like this:
list($first, $second, $testing) = $args;
or called the $args array by indicies to retrieve your parameters.

Sample.php
====================================================================================================
Provides a sample on how to use Deki Extension for Php. To see how it works, simply add it
into the service manager as an extension, and then call it like this:

 {{[namespace].functionName(your params)}}
 
 inside of your DekiWiki page.
