            A good friend of mine was recently involved in a fairly nasty
            accident while driving along a highway in her Honda Accord. She was
            struck from behind by an SUV, spinning her out of control, leaving
            her car lying horizontal in traffic. She was hit again by a pickup
            truck, throwing her car into the median. Moments later, a small
            convertible hit the pickup as it careened out of control across the
            road. She escaped serious injury, as luckily did everyone else
            involved in the accident. But something changed in my friend that
            day, she was afraid to get back behind the wheel of a car and go
            back onto the road. Afraid, until she joined the new "Arms Race":
            SUVs in America.
