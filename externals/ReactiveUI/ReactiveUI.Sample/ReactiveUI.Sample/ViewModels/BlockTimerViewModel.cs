    /* COOLSTUFF: A complex interaction example using Rx
     *
     * Creating a Pomodoro timer is actually a fairly complicated task - despite
     * the fact that this is not *concurrent* (i.e. at the end of the day, we're
     * still only running on one thread), it is very asynchronous, and very
     * prone to corner-cases and tricky ordering problems, since every change
     * affects everything else in the UI.
     *
     * We want to display a timer that counts down from 25 minutes
     * (workDuration), then restarts to 5 minutes (breakDuration), then
     * finishes. Seems easy enough, but here's the part that makes it tricky:
     * when coworkers come in our office, we don't want to lose "credit" for our
     * Pomodoro, so we want to be able to "pause" the timer and resume it.
     *
     * To this end, we've created an explicit state machine, represented by the
     * TimerState Subject - we can push it around via OnNext, then bind the rest 
     * of interactions to this explicit state.

         * these are "read-only properties that change :)"
         *

         * Observable.ToProperty() helper method. They are often really useful
