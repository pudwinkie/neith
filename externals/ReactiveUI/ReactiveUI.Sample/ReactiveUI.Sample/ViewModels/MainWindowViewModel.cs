         * connections between our objects via Observables. Instead of executing
         * code immediately, we're creating Observables and Subscriptions -
         * we're describing what *will* happen when certain events or property
         * changes happen. 
         *
         * This means that the Constructor will often be the most important
         * method in all of your classes, since it is describing the top-level
         * interactions of the entire ViewModel (i.e. the Behavior of your
         * Application)
